About jMock
===========

JMock is a library that supports [test-driven development](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) of [Java](http://java.sun.com) code with [mock objects](http://www.mockobjects.com/).

Mock objects help you design and test the interactions between the objects in your programs.

The jMock library:

-   makes it quick and easy to define mock objects, so you don't break the rhythm of programming.
-   lets you precisely specify the interactions between your objects, reducing the brittleness of your tests.
-   works well with the autocompletion and refactoring features of your IDE
-   plugs into your favourite test framework
-   is easy to extend.
