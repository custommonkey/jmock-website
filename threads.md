Testing Multithreaded Code
==========================

JMock provides a number of APIs to work with multi-threaded code, which let you:

1.  [Unit test an object that executes concurrent tasks](threading-executor.html)
2.  [Unit test an object that schedules tasks](threading-scheduler.html)
3.  [Use JMock with multithreaded code](threading-synchroniser.html)
4.  [Synchronise with threads started by the code under test](threading-waiting.html)
5.  [Stress-test synchronisation code](threading-blitzer.html)
